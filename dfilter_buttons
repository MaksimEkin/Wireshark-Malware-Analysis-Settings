"TRUE","basic ","(http.request or ssl.handshake.type == 1) and !(udp.port eq 1900)","The value http.request reveals URLs for HTTP requests, and ssl.handshake.type == 1 reveals domains names used in HTTPS or SSL/TLS traffic. However, I also generate pcaps of traffic using Windows 7 hosts, and this traffic includes HTTP requests over UDP port 1900 during normal activity. This HTTP traffic over UDP port 1900 is Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP). SSDP is a protocol used to discover Plug & Play devices, and it is not associated with normal web traffic. Therefore, I filter this out using the following expression: \x0a"

These attempted connections can be revealed by including TCP SYN segments in your filter by adding tcp.flags eq 0x0002"

These servers can be directly hosted on IP addresses, or they can be hosted on servers using domain names. Some post-infection activity, like C2 traffic caused by the Nanocore Remote Access Tool (RAT), is not HTTP or HTTPS/SSL/TLS traffic.\x0aTherefore, I often add DNS activity when reviewing a pcap to see if any of these domains are active in the traffic."
